You start by making your order on the kiosk to your right and once it's done you get a text message to come to the counter. I had their signature Melt Burger‚Ñ¢ with a side of their Mac n Cheese. They were 9/10! I was not disappointed at all and I cannot wait to go back!",

A patty melt and tomato soup would have been perfect if I hadn‚Äôt felt so ripped off    I wasn‚Äôt even mad that I ordered it twice second by mistake but after getting the patty pieces back to my room I was horrified! As you can see it was poorly put together I never received a full patty spent $33.70 for two separate meals and it was a mess never again will I be taken advantage of or be served substandard food and waste my hard earned money. I scraped the pile of mushy onions off and ended up wrapping the pieces in the bread after dissecting the entire sandwich. Without the onions that had a ‚Äúfunny taste‚Äù I just dipped it in the soup which WAS EXCELLENT BY THE WAY but never again not even for soup! If some care would have been put into the preparation of the sandwich things would have been lit like the customer service I received when I walked in...nice try! Front of the house was on point ü§∑üèæ",

The Bahn minh version is really tasty, Korean BBQ is great with some spice. If you want chips I would definitely go for Dill Pickles, SO good!",

            "description": "I would definitely come here again. I started off with Curry Puffs, they were smaller than expected, but still delicious. The dough was soft and filling a bit on the sweeter side, by the sauce really sits well with the curry. The Grilled Pork marinade was sweet too, but it was tender and had a nice char. Ask for their hot sauce, if you can handle the kick and use their green chili sauce. Their Basil Fried Rice with beef was great. They give you a lot of meat and could offer some more rice. Mango Sticky Rice was nothing special, but it was tasty and served in big portion; good for sharing.",

The lady was very friendly and the restaurant was clean and nice. Steamed Thai dumplings was the best. Other dishes we ordered were good too. Didn‚Äôt get to try the mango sticky rice coz it is not the mango season yet. But fried ice cream was definitely worth the try. Very affordable price.",

They would have been better without all that mayo like sauce. Chili cheese fries were okay, I probably would not buy again. Super clean place. Everything tastes so fresh even when I didn't care for the taste, that's my issue. The food was still cooked very good and the place clean. It's crowded and can be a wait, completely worth the wait.",
