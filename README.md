With the raise of new technologies, the basic human lives have been dramatically changed. The easiest tasks are being completed through IoT (Internet of things) making people’s routine simpler. There is a shadow side of Information Technologies that not everyone pays enough attention on – socialization. Modern ways of communicating forced people to increase their social anxiety level unintentionally, most of them fear speaking to strangers including making any kind of reservations where calls are needed. This study lights on the need of creative and functional mobile application that would be a path for booking seats in any restaurant in a selected town. The proposed system should allow perspective customers and restaurant owners/administration contact each other via the mobile application or web platform. Besides that, it will have capabilities choosing restaurants based on their preferences/allergies/price limit, making orders in prior to avoid a wait, ordering delivery/takeout, rating service, viewing other people’s reviews. The aim is decreasing crowd of people during rush hours and weekends, bearing in mind latest events with COVID-19 and making possible for social anxious people or introverts to book in a desired café with no stress.
